### 👋🏻 Hi! 
I’m Sayali (pronounced “s AA y - l ee”). I’m a software engineer who enjoys building applications incorporating my creativity and problem-solving skills. The best part is that I’m allowed to break the code to improve it (in a separate Git branch, of course!).<br><br>💻 I specialize in full-stack development, database optimization, domain-driven designing, and implementation of responsive design principles with expertise in React, Next.js, Java, Python, and more for every project.<br>

- 🎯 I'm seeking new opportunities to apply my skills in a dynamic environment.
- 💬 Ask me about React.js, JavaScript.
- 📫 How to reach me: sayalisuniltandel@gmail.com

<br>✨ I am a firm believer in creating user-friendly, scalable, and secure applications with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and test-driven development (TDD) to minimize bugs and speed up the release cycle. But, If I’m not in front of my laptop, I’m most likely trying out new recipes or journaling.<br>

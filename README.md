<h1 align="center">Hi <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampavangandhi/iampavangandhi/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px"> I'm Sayali Tandel</h1>
I’m a software engineer who enjoys building applications incorporating my creativity and problem-solving skills. The best part is that I’m allowed to break the code to improve it (in a separate Git branch, of course!).<br><br>💻 I specialize in full-stack development, database optimization, domain-driven designing, and implementation of responsive design principles with expertise in React, Next.js, Java, Python, and more for every project.<br>

- 🎯 I'm seeking new opportunities to apply my skills in a dynamic environment.
- 💬 Ask me about React.js, JavaScript.

<strong>Also,</strong>
<br>✨ I am a firm believer in creating user-friendly, scalable, and secure applications with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and test-driven development (TDD) to minimize bugs and speed up the release cycle. But, If I’m not in front of my laptop, I’m most likely trying out new recipes or journaling.<br>
